## Description  
Lira is an AI-powered app that generates accurate transcripts and subtitles from audio and video files.  

I originally built this app for friends who donâ€™t speak much Spanish, so they could enjoy videos with real-time subtitles. Over time, I added more flexibility and features â€” like giving users the choice of translation models and making the interface more user-friendly.
